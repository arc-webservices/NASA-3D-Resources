3D model of Hurricane Julio

This model depicts Hurricane Julio on Aug. 7, 2014, as it churned in the Eastern Pacific with maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 km/h). At the time of the satellite images used to make this model, 2100 UTC, Julio was a Category 2 storm centered near latitude 17.1 degrees north and longitude 137.7 degrees west. 

The model is based on visible and infrared images taken by the GOES 15 satellite. These were merged for aesthetic effect and cropped to a square around the storm. Elevations were assigned based on the brightness of sampled pixels to generate vertical height, which is exaggerated here by about 10 times assuming a typical height of 50,000 feet (15 km). Printed at its default size, the Julio model is 13.5 cm (5.3 inches) on each side, which represents an actual distance of 1,267 km (787 miles).

This model is in the public domain. The GOES 15 images used to develop it were retrieved through the NASA/NOAA GOES Project at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov).
