Included in this zip file are .stl-formatted and .obj-formatted 3D-printable models of the Eta Carinae Homunculus nebula. This 3D model was derived by Steffen, W., Teodoro, M., Madura, T., et al. 2014 and published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. You can access the journal article directly at http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/mnras/stu1088

An original version of this zip file and accompanying information about the 3D model are available at http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?11568

You are free to use these model files as you wish, and you are highly encouraged to 3D-print your own Homunculus. 

We understand that 3D printing often involves trial and error, so you are welcome to make adjustments, share the model, etc. We only request that proper credit and/or citation to Steffen, W., Teodoro, M., Madura, T., et al. (2014), and a link to the original model (above) be provided when appropriate.

The authors of the Monthly Notices paper also wish to thank the following for their help and enthusiasm during the 3D printing process; the project would not have been such a success without them.
